SYNOPSIS
========

| |command| [ **-U** ] [ **-p** `PORT` ] [ **-d** ] [ `HOMEDIR` ]
| |command| **-i** [ `IDTOOL_ARG` ... ]
| |command| **-q** [ `QUERY_ARG` ... ]
| |command| **-h**
| |command| **-v**


DESCRIPTION
===========

**ZeroTier One** is the end-point peer for the ZeroTier
software-defined network layer.

*ZeroTier* is a peer-to-peer virtual network. Its “virtual layer 1”
(VL1) is implemented in the communication between ZeroTier One peers.
This provides the OSI layer 1 functionality on which to build further
network services.


OPTIONS
=======

**-h**
    Display concise help on command usage.

**-v**
    Display program version.

**-U**
    Run as unprivileged user (skip privilege check).

**-p** `PORT`
    Communicate on network port `PORT` (either TCP or UDP).

**-d**
    Become a conventional daemon process. Only available on Unix-like
    operating systems.

**-i** [ `IDTOOL_ARG` ... ]
    Generate and manage identities.

    This is equivalent to running the **zerotier-idtool** command with
    all the specified `IDTOOL_ARG` parameters.

**-q** [ `QUERY_ARG` ... ]
    Query the running ZeroTier One process.

    This is equivalent to running the **zerotier-cli** command with
    all the specified `QUERY_ARG` parameters.


FILES

The |command| process will store its state in files within the
specified `HOMEDIR` directory (default: ``/var/lib/zerotier-one``).
