ZeroTier Integrations
====

This is a collection of example projects demonstrating how you can embed or integrate ZeroTier functionality directly into your applications and games with *little to no change to your code*. 

For more support on these integrations take a look at the [docs](../docs) folder. Specifically the [Shims](../docs/shims_zt_sdk.md) and [SDK API](../docs/zt_sdk.md) overviews. 
Also stop by our [community section](https://www.zerotier.com/community/) for more in-depth discussion!

## Current Integrations

### Apple
We've created a single [XCode project](/Apple) which will build every target you need for iOS/OSX/Unity development. You'll want to grab that project, build the target for the type of development you want to do and then use it in one of the platform-specific integration tutorials below:
##### iOS
 - [Embedding within an app](../docs/ios_zt_sdk.md)
 - [Unity3D plugin](../docs/unity3d_ios_zt_sdk.md)

##### OSX
 - [Embedding within an app](../docs/osx_zt_sdk.md) 
 - [Dynamic-linking into an app/service at runtime](../docs/osx_zt_sdk.md) 
 - [Unity3D plugin](../docs/unity3d_osx_zt_sdk.md) 

***
### Linux
 - [Dynamic-linking into an app/service at runtime](../docs/linux_zt_sdk.md) 
 - [Using the SDK with Docker](../docs/docker_linux_zt_sdk.md)

### Android
 - [Embedding within an app](../docs/android_zt_sdk.md) 
 - [Unity 3D plugin](../docs/unity3d_android_zt_sdk.md) 

***
### Windows
 - Anyone want to volunteer?
