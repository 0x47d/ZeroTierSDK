ZeroTier Integrations
====

This is a collection of example projects demonstrating how you can embed or integrate ZeroTier functionality directly into your applications and games with *little to no change to your code*. 

For more support on these integrations take a look at the [docs](../docs) folder. Specifically the [Shims](../docs/shims_zt_sdk.md) and [SDK API](../docs/zt_sdk.md) overviews. 
Also stop by our [community section](https://www.zerotier.com/community/) for more in-depth discussion!

## Current Integrations

If you want everything built at once, type `make all` and go play outside for a little while, we'll put all of the built targets into the `build` directory for you along with specific instructions on how to use each binary.
