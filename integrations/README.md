ZeroTier Integrations
====

If you want everything built at once, type `make all` and go play outside for a few minutes, we'll copy all of the targets into the `build` directory for you along with specific instructions on how to use each binary. You can then use `make -s check` to check the build status of each binary target.

*NOTE for Apple platforms: In order to build iOS/OSX Frameworks and Bundles you will need XCode command line tools `xcode-select --install`*

*NOTE: For Android JNI libraries to build you'll need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html), and you'll need to tell our project where you put it by putting the path in [this file](Android/proj/local.properties), if you don't have these things installed and configured we will detect that and just skip those builds automatically. Additionally, you can specify the target architectures you want to build in [Application.mk](android/java/jni/Application.mk). By default it will build `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi`, `armeabi-v7a`, `mips`, `mips64`, `x86`, and `x86_64`*

Below are the specific instructions for each integration requiring *little to no modification to your code*. Remember, with a full build we'll put a copy of the appropriate integration instructions in the resultant binary's folder for you anyway.
